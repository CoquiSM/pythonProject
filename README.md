This exercises tested my ability to use arrays and loops in a more technical way. Instead of doing superficial loops with counters it incoprorates he use of nested loops and logic to 
present a deeper undertsading of Python. even though it just scratches the surface it demosntrates my ability to problem solve and streamline my code to not only make it easier to read and follow
on dry runs but also minimize the quanitity of lines used. My philosphy is that the simpler the code the less problems it will cause. Having multiple pieces of machinery can make the whole engine stop.
